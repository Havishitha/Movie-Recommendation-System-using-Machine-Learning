## Introduction
In this project, we develop a recommendation system to suggest movies to users. The goal is to enhance the user experience by providing tailored movie suggestions based on user preferences and behavior.

---

## Features
- Content-based filtering using movie metadata (genres, actors, directors).
- Collaborative filtering using user-item interaction matrices.
- Hybrid model combining content and collaborative filtering.
- User-friendly interface for movie searches and recommendations.

---

## Dataset
The project uses the [MovieLens Dataset](https://grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/):
- Contains user ratings, movie metadata (genres, release year, etc.), and tags.
- Preprocessed to handle missing values and duplicates.

---

## Model Overview
- **Content-Based Filtering**: Uses cosine similarity and TF-IDF to compare movie metadata.
- **Collaborative Filtering**: Matrix factorization with Singular Value Decomposition (SVD).
- **Hybrid Model**: Combines the strengths of content and collaborative filtering.
